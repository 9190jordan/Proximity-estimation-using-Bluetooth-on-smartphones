# Proximity-estimation-using-Bluetooth-on-smartphones

# Description
We demonstrate through experimental studies the efficacy of Bluetooth for this exact purpose. We propose a proximity estimation model to determine the distance based on the RSSI values of Bluetooth and light sensor data in different environments. 

We demonstrate the viability of using Bluetooth for the purposes of face-to-face proximity estimation and propose a proximity estimation model with appropriate smoothing and consideration of a wide variety of typical environments. 

We study the relationship between the value of Bluetooth RSSI and distance based on empirical measurements and compares the results with the theoretical results using the radio propagation model. 

# Data Collection System
In this module, our system collects Bluetooth data including the detailed values of RSSI, MAC address, and Bluetooth identifier (BTID). The data is recorded once the phone detects other Bluetooth devices around. In addition to Bluetooth, data points from a variety of other subsystems (light sensor, battery level and etc.) are gathered in order to compare and improve the proximity estimation. Separate threads are employed to compensate for the variety of speeds at which the respective subsystems offer relevant data.
